Revision history for Perl extension Mail::IMAPTalk.

3.01  Tue Jul 10 11:00 2012
  - Bumping major version again because of fetch response
     format changes (Content-Disposition and annotation changes)
  - Documentation updates.
     Update to SORT RFC, update to latest ACL RFC
  - Update get_response_code docs
  - Alert reponse is remainder of line, put that in the response code
     Hack around fact alert response is the remainder of the
     line after the ], it's not an argument inside the [...],
     but make it look that way because makes API easier
     to just call get_response_code
  - Deal with annoying ANSI_X3.4-1968 encoded headers
  - Handle servers which don't return any untagged sort/search results, but OK response
  - Add a Pedantic mode to the parser
     Will die if a line with an unexpected tag appears
     when parsing responses. Useful for test suite
     writers.
  - Fix parsing of server welcome banner
  - Always increase CmdId, and rethrow error in pedantic mode
  - Handle buggy multiple spaces in XIMAPPROXY response
  - Doc updates and misc fixes
  - Make Mail::IMAPTalk work on perl 5.8
  - Add per-command parse mode, and parsing for annotations
  - Document unicode folders and remove old warnings
  - Improve find_message
  - Typo fixes, remove need for Carp
  - use RFC2047 not RFC1522
  - Atoms can have } in them
  - Allow reporting errors for multigetannotation
  - Add IDLE command support
  - Break Content-Disposition into separate parts like Content-Type
    (NOTE: This changes the result of fetches and is backwards
     incompatible)
  - Improve find_message
  - Handle literals that fail better (eg no + go ahead response)
  - Strip newlines if server returns them (it should have unfolded)
  - Allow release_socket() to take an error flag
  - Show correct system error on system errors
